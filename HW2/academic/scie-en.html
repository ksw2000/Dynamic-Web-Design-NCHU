                <h2>College of Science</h2>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>State-of-the-art research to keep up with the world</li>
                    <li>Close connection with industry</li>
                    <li>Excellent teaching courses,solid infrastructure, multi-trackdegree programs</li>
                    <li>The library of science is also a resource center for Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and partly supported by National Science Council</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Status</h3>
                <p>The College of Science consists of the Departments of <em>Chemistry, Applied Mathematics, Physics.</em> Every Department offers BS, MS and PhD programs. The College caters for about 800 undergraduate, 260 MS and 60 PhD students. There are 100 fulltime faculty members of the College who are all specialized in their particular fields. The College is striving to raise the faculty member/student ratio to further enhance teaching and advance research. Every year, NSC sponsors about 80 projects with a total grant support of around NT $100,000,000.</p>

                <p><em>Chemistry</em>: Current research topics include the synthesis and reactivity studies of organic-, bio- & porphyrins-related compounds, highly efficient catalysts, inorganic nano materials, micro-analytic techniques, biosensors, biomimetic nano science computational & nano physical chemistry.</p>

                <p><em>Applied Mathematics</em>: Focus on applied analysis, applied statistics, applied mechanics, mathematical models,and computer skills. The department is best known for computer applications of advanced mathematical techniques.</p>

                <p><em>Physics</em>: The expertise of the faculty covers all major fields in physics. Fundamental physics and interdisciplinary science are emphasized in student training. The establishment of Institute of Nanoscience in 2008, prompted by the rapid development in nanotechnology and nanoscience and also the strong demand in personnel training in this area, has provided a comprehensive platform for research and education. The focused research topics include nanophononics, nanomaterials, nanoelectronic devices, nanodiagnosis and manipulation technologies, quantum electronics, and cutting-edge applications in solar cells and biomedical optoelectronics. The institute has state-of-art facility for developing highly innovative, interdisciplinary research in nanoscience.</p>

                <h3>Future Development</h3>
                <p>The College will make effective use of its resources to strengthen its teaching in basic science, accelerate research in advanced topics, and enhance its involvement in society.</p>

                <h3>Teaching</h3>
                <p>A teaching center will be established to coordinate all kinds of teaching activities and improve teaching evaluation methods.</p>
                <p>The concept of environmental protection and green lab will be emphasized and its applications will be further illustrated in all chemistry labs.</p>
                <p>Calculus will be taught according to the levels of course and the level of the students. Graphic software will be employed substantially to improve teaching in mathematics.</p>
                <p>More interdisciplinary courses or courses related to the topics of contemporary physics will be offered.</p>
                <p>Professional discipline in computer science will be strengthened and additional courses specially tailored for students planning to work in the industry will be offered.</p>
                <p>The Networking and Multimedia institute focuses on training graduates to have analytical, design, and integration capabilities. In order to match the trends of multimedia information technology, research areas such as medical information engineering, mobile multimedia, and network management and security will receive more focus.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Promote cooperative projects in interdisciplinary research</li>
                    <li>Promote reciprocal visits among universities</li>
                    <li>Focus on nanotechnology and biophysics</li>
                    <li>Encourage the faculty to publish research papers and build connections with the world</li>
                </ul>
